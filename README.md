# ðŸ‘‹ Hello, I'm Mattia!

Iâ€™m an interested in machine learning, AI, and data science. Iâ€™m currently focused on deep learning, statistical models, and machine learning, and Iâ€™m always looking for ways to expand my knowledge and collaborate with others! I'm familiar with Python and Java. I've used various data science libraries, including **Pandas**, **SciKit-Learn**, **PyTorch**, **Plotly**, and **NumPy**. I'm also interested in learning web development to showcase my AI/ML projects.
